# Low Level Graphics Project
A moire pattern project using low level graphics packages.

## Technology
I used Java for this project, using the Java AWT and Javax Swing packages for my graphics processing.

## Challenges and Takeaways
One of my main challenges was centering the circles that I used in my project. I found that was harder to do than it would seem because the built in drawOval() function takes parameters for the top left corner of the oval instead of the center, and I had to do a little math to position the ovals the way I wanted. In general, there were some effects that I found unexpected, like the blue oval figure that appears off to the side. I'm really happy with how the yellow oval "light" strip turned out, though admittedly I got it mostly through trial and error, as I did with the rest of the components to get them to look how I wanted. I'm definitely more cognizant now of the difficulty in creating low level graphics, especially since positioning is often based off of the top left corner of a rectangle, even when the shape is different from a rectangle.
